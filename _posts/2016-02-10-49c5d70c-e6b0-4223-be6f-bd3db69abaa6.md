What a
great time I had in Sarajevo! I met some really wonderful and crazy 
people, some great musicians and got to know this astonishing city. 
Unfortunately the war has destroyed a lot and one can still see quite a 
lot of the damage, but what I found really great is the mix of cultures 
and religions in this city. Islam, Judaism and Christianity right in one
spot.

That's one big wish I'd like to happen again in the future - everywhere.
